Dr. Bader develops biological network analysis and pathway information resources. He created the Biomolecular Interation Network Database ( [BIND](http://bind.ca) ) while working on his PhD and currently helps lead development of the free Cytoscape network visualization and analysis software [Cytoscape](http://cytoscape.org/). 

#### Lincoln Stein
Head, Adaptive Oncology,<br> OICR

<img src="./img/faculty/lincoln_stein.jpeg" style="float:right;width:125px;padding-left:10px;" />
Dr. Stein played an integral role in many large-scale data initiatives including the development of the first physical clone map of the human genome, and running the data coordinating centre and the data portal for the SNP Consortium and the HapMap Consortium. Dr. Stein has also led the creation and development of Wormbase, a community model organism database for C. elegans, and Reactome, which is now the largest open community database of biological reactions and pathways. At OICR, Dr. Stein has led several international cancer data sharing and research initiatives, including the creation and development of the data coordination centre for the International Cancer Genome Consortium and other related projects. He continues to collaborate with national and international partners to create and promote data sharing standards, protocols and implementations.

#### Gregory Schwartz
Scientist,<br>Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, <br>University Health Network

<img src="./img/faculty/gregory_schwartz.jpeg" style="float:left;width:125px;padding-right:10px;" />
Dr. Schwartz is a Scientist at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre and Assistant Professor in the Department of Medical Biophysics at the University of Toronto. He has developed several methodologies for mutation detection, data integration, and cellular population visualization to understand cancer heterogeneity and diverse responses to anti-cancer therapies. His current research involves integrating multi-omic information and leveraging single-cell resolution to identify underlying mechanisms of drug resistance in cancer.

#### Veronique Voisin
Research Associate,<br> Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Biomolecular Research, <br>University of Toronto 

<img src="./img/faculty/veronique_voisin.jpeg" style="float:right;width:125px;padding-left:10px;" />
Veronique is currently a bioinformatician applying pathway and networks analysis to high throughput genomics data for OICR cancer stem cell program. Previously, she worked on characterizing the gene signatures of different types of leukemias using a murine model

#### Ruth Isserlin
Research data analyst,<br>Donnelly Centre for Cellular and Bimolecular Research, <br>University of Toronto

<img src="./img/faculty/ruth_isserlin.jpeg" style="float:left;width:125px;padding-right:10px;" />
Bioinformatician and data analyst in the Bader lab applying pathway and data analysis to varied data types. Developed Enrichment Map App for Cytoscape, an app to visually translate functional enrichment results from popular enrichment tools like GSEA to networks. Further developed the Enrichment Map Pipeline including development of additional Apps to help summarize and analyze resulting Enrichment Maps, including PostAnalysis, WordCloud, and AutoAnnotate App. 

#### Chaitra Sarathy, PhD
Bioinformatics Specialist, <br>Krembil Research Institute, <br>University Health Network

<img src="./img/faculty/Chaitra_Sarathy.jpeg" style="float:right;width:125px;padding-left:10px;" />
Dr. Sarathy is a computational biologist with industry experience in software development. Her previous research focussed on developing multi-scale mathematical models of human systems to characterise biochemical changes in obesity. In addition, she has developed methods based on machine learning and multi-omics integration to identify drug targets in cancer and stratify patients for clinical trials. She currently focusses on characterising genetic malfunctions in neurological diseases.
